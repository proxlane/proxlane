`HealthState` now carries `enteredAt`, so the state a store persists is exactly the state the machine needs; `observe` and `observeProbe` take `now` and nothing else. `INITIAL` is replaced by `initial(now)`. Conformance requires the fixture categories that prove an adapter can tell a target failure from its own.
