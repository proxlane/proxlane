ScraperAPI now reads the target's status from `sa-statuscode` instead of matching body prose, and reports the real credit cost from `sa-credit-cost` — a rendered request previously billed at 1 credit instead of 10. A target returning 403 is now `HARD_BLOCK` rather than `AUTH_FAILED`, which had marked the caller's own key unhealthy.
